# Blocks
I started this project because several of my friends in high school mentioned to me that they felt like knowing how to code would be a useful skill, but learning the intricacies of a programming language was too much effort. I figured that if there was a way to make a drag-and-drop programming interface that allowed for classes, protocols, and object-oriented programming, people who didn't want to invest in learning a programming language would then be able to program mostly by intuition.

The program can execute simple blocks of code like the one displayed below. It features variables, loops, modular if-else statements, arrays, and dictionaries. Instructions written using the program can be saved by the user and modified at a later date.

I ended up abandoning the project because I didn't know enough about the underlying principles to make it work at the time, but I intend to revisit it when I've learned more about what that project would entail.
